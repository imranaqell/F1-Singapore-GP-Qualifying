# F1-Singapore-GP-Qualifying
This year's Singapore GP has to be the most exciting one to watch as the gap between top 3 was only half a tenth of a second. It was very intense that I could barely sit still. I then decided to make an analysis on the comparison of the laps pulled by the top 3 drivers which are Leclerc, Perez and Hamilton.
